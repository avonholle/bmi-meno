:Title: A CONSORT-style flowchart of a randomized controlled trial
:Tags: Matrices, Charts
:Author: Morten Vejs Willert
:Slug: consort-flowchart

A flowchart is an efficient graphical tool for depicting the 
progress of subjects through the phases of a clinical trial. 
This example shows how to use the PGF/TikZ package within a 
LaTeX article class document to make a flowchart of participants
progress through the phases of a randomized controlled trial. 
The flowchart is meant to conform to the specifications of the 
CONSORT 2010 Statement guidelines adhered to by the majority 
of scientific biomedical journals. The author takes no 
responsibility whether this goal has been achieved successfully,
should anyone care to use the example as a template when 
submitting a manuscript of their own to a biomedical journal. 

The basic code regarding placement of the nodes within a matrix, 
as well as for drawing paths between nodes, was adapted from the 
example by Kjell Magne Fauske in 'The TikZ and PGF Packages Manual 
for version 2.00' by Till Tantau.

In the example the tikzpicture-environment is used within a center
environment and \captionof from the caption package, because floating
is not required and conflicts with the preview package. In a common
document, a standard figure environment is recommended, which allows
the addition of a caption to  accompany the flowchart, as well as
options for placement of the float when typesetting the document.
